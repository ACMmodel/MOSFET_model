# ACM model in verilog-A for circuit simulation

The ACM model can be used in open-source(learn about [openVAF](/Verilog-A/openvaf)) or commercial circuit simulators due to the universality of the Verilog-A language.

Here you found the verilog-a files of the [NMOS](/Verilog-A/NMOS_ACM_2V0.va) and [PMOS](/Verilog-A/PMOS_ACM_2V0.va) transistors.
