# ACM in Verilog-A language for circuit simulation

THE ACM can be used in open-source or commercial circuit simulators due to the universality of the Verilog-A language.

Here you found the verilog-a files of the [NMOS](/Verilog-A/NMOS_ACM_2V0.va) and [PMOS](/Verilog-A/PMOS_ACM_2V0.va) transistors.
