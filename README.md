# About ACM
The ACM is a charge-based physical model. All the large signal characteristics (currents and charges) and the small signal parameters ((trans)conductances and (trans)capacitances) are given by single-piece expressions in all regions of operation. It also preserves the structural source-drain symmetry of the transistor.

The model is available for commercial and open-source EDA tools due to the versatility of the Verilog-A language.
This repository presents the Verilog-A code for the NMOS and PMOS transistors, documentation about the model through papers and reports, and comparison of the model with PDK models or measurements of the three available open-source process (Sky130, IHP, and GF180).
