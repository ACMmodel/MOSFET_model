# Advanced Compact MOSFET model (ACM)
 ACM is a simple MOSFET model to design and simulate Analog, Mixed-Signal, and RF circuits

As of July 2023, this repository targets to release all future versions and technical support about the ACM model.

# About ACM
The ACM is a charge-based physical model. All the large signal characteristics (currents and charges) and the small signal parameters ((trans)conductances and (trans)capacitances) are given by single-piece expressions in all regions of operation. It also preserves the structural source-drain symmetry of the transistor.

The model is available for commercial and open-source EDA tools due to the versatility of the Verilog-A language.
This repository presents the Verilog-A code for the NMOS and PMOS transistors, documentation about the model through papers and reports, and a comparison of the model with PDK models or measurements of the three available open-source processes (Sky130, IHPSG13, and GF180MCU).


Researchers are kindly requested to include the following citation if the ACM2V0 model is used in their research.
