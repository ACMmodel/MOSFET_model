# Advanced Compact MOSFET model

The ACM is a minimalist model consisting of single-piece functions and is not restricted to the low-voltage domain. 
All the large signal characteristics (currents and charges) and the small signal parameters (trans) single-piece expressions in all regions of operation will give conductances. 
The five parameters are the threshold voltage $V_{T0}$, the specific current $I_S$, the slope factor n, the DIBL coefficient $\sigma$, and the parameter $\zeta$ associated with saturation velocity. 
The ACM model will preserve the structural source-drain symmetry of the transistor. It will also be charge-conserving and have explicit equations for the MOSFET 8 (trans)capacitances \cite{yellowACM}.
