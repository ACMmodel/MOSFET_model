[2023 - A 5-DC-parameter MOSFET model for circuit simulation in QucsStudio and Spectre](/docs/2023_A_5-DC-parameter_MOSFET_model_for_circuit_simulation_in_QucsStudio_and_Spectre.pdf)

 Abstract: 
> A minimalist MOSFET model for circuit simulation
> with only five DC parameters written in Verilog-A is presented.
> The five parameters can be extracted from direct and simple
> methods in common circuit simulators. The DC characteristics
> of transistors in both 180-nm bulk CMOS and 28-nm FD-SOI
> technologies generated by the five-parameter model are compared
> with those generated by the BSIM and UTSOI2 models, respectively.
> The simulation of some basic circuits using the proposed
> 5-DC-parameter MOSFET model shows good matching with the
> simulation using the BSIM model, for the benefit of a much
> a simpler set of DC parameters.






[2022 - Bridging the gap between design and simulation of low-voltage CMOS circuits](/docs/2022_Bridging_the_Gap_between_Design_and_Simulation_of_Low-Voltage_CMOS_Circuits.pdf)

Abstract: 
> This work proposes a truly compact MOSFET model that contains only four parameters
> to assist an integrated circuits (IC) designer in a design by hand. The four-parameter model (4PM)
> is based on the advanced compact MOSFET (ACM) model and was implemented in Verilog-A to
> simulate different circuits designed with the ACM model in Verilog-compatible simulators. Being
> able to simulate MOS circuits through the same model used in a hand design benefits designers
> in understanding how the main MOSFET parameters affect the design. Herein, the classic CMOS
> inverter, a ring oscillator, a self-biased current source and a common source amplifier were designed
> and simulated using either the 4PM or the BSIM model. The four-parameter model was simulated
> in many sorts of circuits with very satisfactory results in the low-voltage cases. As the ultra-lowvoltage (ULV) domain is expanding due to applications, such as the internet of things and wearable
> circuits, so is the use of a simplified ULV MOSFET model
