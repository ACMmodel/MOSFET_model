[A 5-DC-parameter MOSFET model for circuit simulation in QucsStudio and Spectre](/docs/2023_A_5-DC-parameter_MOSFET_model_for_circuit_simulation_in_QucsStudio_and_Spectre.pdf)

Abstract: 
A minimalist MOSFET model for circuit simulation
with only five DC parameters written in Verilog-A is presented.
The five parameters can be extracted from direct and simple
methods in common circuit simulators. The DC characteristics
of transistors in both 180-nm bulk CMOS and 28-nm FD-SOI
technologies generated by the five-parameter model are compared
with those generated by the BSIM and UTSOI2 models, respectively.
The simulation of some basic circuits using the proposed
5-DC-parameter MOSFET model shows good matching with the
simulation using the BSIM model, at the benefit of a much
simpler set of DC parameters.
