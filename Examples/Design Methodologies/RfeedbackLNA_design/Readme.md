#Design Methodology for Resistive-Feedback LNA using ACM2




This repository provides scripts, documentation, and examples for designing resistive-feedback low-noise amplifiers (R-feedback LNAs) using the Advanced Compact MOSFET Model 2 (ACM2).

The methodology leverages the normalized inversion charge formulation of ACM2 to enable analytical exploration of design trade-offs (gain, noise figure, linearity, impedance matching) without relying solely on heavy CAD simulations.
